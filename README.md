Dynamic web page with gifs of animals

This web page takes gifs from the GIPHY API. The web page is based on
the animal theme.

The user clicks the button with the label of the animal the user desires
to to display. The web page then displays 10 gifs of that animal.
The gif is initially in the non-animated state. However, if the user clicks
the image, the image goes into the animated state. By clicking the image,
the image toggles between the animated and non-animated state.

The user may create a button by entering a name of an animal in the input
form and clicking the "Submit" button. The input form has error checking for
entering the name of an existing button and not entering anything.
